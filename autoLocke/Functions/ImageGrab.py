"""
Summary:

takeSection requires section, and gen variables.
The Section should be one of "Route" or "Caught", which would capture the Route or Caught pokemon respectively. 
Gen is which generation of game. For example, to catch the Route of Fire Red, you would need different image dimensions than
Emerald. 


takeScreenshot gets called from takeSection. It requires the filepath, x,y,width and height, which are the dimensions of the
screenshot requested. All of these variables are given automatically from takeSection and they vary(able) based on which
section was requested.
